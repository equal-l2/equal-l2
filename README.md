I'm an undergraduate student majoring in CS.  
(I majored in physics for four years though never graduated)  

I'm good at:  
- Rust ðŸ¦€ (my favourite language)
- C++ ðŸª„(using in my part-time job. my ex-favourite)
- Google-fu (always helping friends Google)
- resolving others' trouble (not good at resolving my own, unfortunately)

I know the basics of:
- Java (the favourite language of CS dept.)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (unless involving "modern" toolchains)
- Vue3 (only 26 hours of learning, just for one coding test)
