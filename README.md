I'm an undergraduate student majoring in CS.  
(I majored in physics for several years though never graduated)  

I'm good at:  
- Rust ðŸ¦€ (my favourite language)
- C++ ðŸª„(using in my part-time job. my ex-favourite)
- Google-fu (seriously, I get every knowledge by Googling)
- resolving others' trouble (I'm not good at resolving my own problem, though)

I know the basics of:
- Java (the favourite language of CS dept.)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (unless involving "modern" toolchains)
